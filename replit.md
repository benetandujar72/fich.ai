## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo architecture with clear separation between client and server code:
- **Client**: React-based frontend using TypeScript and Vite for development
- **Server**: Express.js backend with TypeScript
- **Shared**: Common schema definitions and types shared between client and server

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (language preferences) and TanStack Query for server state
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and dark mode support
- **Internationalization**: Custom i18n system supporting Catalan and Spanish languages

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect for secure user authentication
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage using connect-pg-simple
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses and comprehensive error handling

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL using Neon serverless for scalability
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema evolution
- **Key Entities**: Users, Institutions, Employees, Departments, Schedules, Attendance Records, Absences, Alerts, and Settings
- **Data Relationships**: Well-defined foreign key relationships ensuring data integrity
- **Session Storage**: Dedicated sessions table for authentication state persistence

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication Provider**: Replit Auth with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- **Session Security**: HTTP-only secure cookies with configurable TTL
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (superadmin, admin, employee) with institution-based permissions
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection with server-side validation

### Development & Build Pipeline
- **Development Server**: Vite with HMR for fast frontend development
- **Backend Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend bundling and esbuild for backend compilation
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled

### API Structure
The backend provides RESTful endpoints organized by feature:
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` for user authentication and profile management
- **Dashboard**: `/api/dashboard/*` for statistics and overview data
- **Employees**: `/api/employees/*` for employee CRUD operations
- **Attendance**: `/api/attendance/*` for time tracking and presence management
- **Alerts**: `/api/alerts/*` for notification and alert management
- **Reports**: `/api/reports/*` for generating attendance and compliance reports
